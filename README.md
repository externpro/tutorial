externpro tutorial

I came across this simple and straightforward video on YouTube
"C++ Package Management for Beginners: vcpkg and Conan Tutorial"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kiAklZGJJE

And I decided to create this tutorial repository that uses the same example CMakeLists.txt and main.cpp to show how simple, straightforward, and powerful externpro is to streamline your C++ projects.
